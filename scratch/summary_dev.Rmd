# Objective & Details {.tabset .tabset-pills}
Determine sources of variability for the CHANGE-Seq assay.

## Approach

1. Samples are prepared with the CHANGE-Seq wet lab procedure.
2. Samples are pooled and sequenced. 
3. Resulting FASTQ files are run through the CHANGE-Seq program. 
4. Each samples produces an "identified_matched.txt" file which is what is used and described in this document. 

**Downstream Bioinformatic Analysis:**

1. Loading CHANGE-Seq pipeline output (namely - "identified_matched.txt" files)
2. Annotating CHANGE-Seq data frame with sample pair/replicate information
3. Summary/ Statistical Analysis  
    1. Generating Summary Table  
    2. Interlaboratory Comparison Plots

### Data Pre-Run Steps

**Reference Genome**

Cicera:
> You can download hg38 sequence from: https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/ and concatenate only the main chromosome sequences as hg38_chroms_only.fa

I downloaded all files with this naming scheme: "chrom1.fa.gz" + X & Y and concatenated files via:

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
cd ~/Desktop/reference_genome
cat *.fa > ~/Desktop/reference_genome/combined_hg38_chroms.fa
```

**Trimmed NIST-sequenced files due to extra cycling with our kit via:**

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
seqtk trimfq -e 150 \
A_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz > A_S1_L001_R1_001_trimmed.fq
```

## Plots
### Total Read Counts & On-Target Read Counts per Sample

For each target site, each lab's total read count is plotted. This gives an idea how much data is generated as a whole for each target site. For each target site, each lab's total on-target read count is plotted. 


```{r}
ggplot(total_count_df) + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = target_site, y = total_read_count, fill = lab), 
             position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
    labs(x = "Editing Target Site", y = "Total Read Count", 
         fill = "Lab")
```
```{r}
ggplot(target_count_df) + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = target_site, y = on_target_count, fill = lab), 
             position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
    labs(x = "Editing Target Site", y = "Total On-Target Read Count", 
         fill = "Lab")
```


Sample F for NSS has a drastically lower read count. 
This was found to be a copy/paste error in their manifest file. 
They were pointing to sample E's read fastq files. 

### On-Target Rate

For each target site, each lab's on target rate (total on-target read count / total read count) is plotted. 

``````{r}
ggplot(on_off_target_df) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = target_site, y = on_target_rate, fill = lab), 
               shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
        labs(x = "Editing Target Site", y = "On Target Rate", 
         fill = "Lab")
```

On-target rates for sample A, E, and F are nearly matched and variance for samples B, C, and D is observed. NIST-sequenced samples are slightly higher.

### Off-Target Rate

For each target site, each lab's off-target rate (off-target read count / total read count) is plotted.

``````{r}
ggplot(off_target_ratio) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = target_site, y = off_target_ratio, fill = lab), 
               shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
        labs(x = "Editing Target Site", y = "Off Target Rate", 
         fill = "Lab")
```

The rates of the off-target sequences are generally all higher than that of the on-target rates. Like the on-target rates, samples A, E, and F are similar in value. Samples B, C, and D have variance with the inverse of the above - the off-target rates are higher for the St. Jude-sequenced samples than that of the NIST-sequenced samples. 


### Off-target Sequence Alignment: Sub/Gap

For each target site, the number of off-target sequences that are resolved by substitutions only, indels (gaps) only, or substitutions *or* gaps are plotted for each lab. 

```{r}
off_target_seq_align_df %>% 
    ## First make the table long
    gather(key = "metric", value = "value", -changeseq_run, -lab, -target_site)
```

```{r}
off_target_seq_align_df %>% 
    ## First make the table long
    gather(key = "metric", value = "value", -changeseq_run, -lab, -target_site) %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = metric, 
                 y = value,
                 fill = lab),
             position = "dodge", 
             stat = "identity"
             ) +
    ## Split plot by summary metric
    facet_wrap(~target_site, scales = "free_y") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -45, hjust = 0)) +
  labs(x = "Mismatch Type", y = "Number of Sequences", fill = "Lab")
```

The off-target sequences are aligned to the target sequence. These are binned in the following manner: in order to align properly to the target sequence, the off-target sequence could be resolve with substitutions (and assigned a substitution number), gaps (insertions or deletions) or by both possibilities. Here, I have binned them accordingly. As before, no differences are observed between the samples sequenced at St. Jude but run through the CHANGE-Seq bioinformatics pipeline by me and St. Jude, however, variance is observed between the samples sequenced at NIST vs. St. Jude. For samples A and B, NIST-sequenced off-target reads are overall in lower numbers as compared to St. Jude.


### Top 25% off-target read counts

For each target site, weighted by read count, the top 25% off-target sequence read counts for each lab are plotted. 

```{r}
ggplot(top_quarter_off_target_df) + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = target_site, y = top_quarter_offtarget_readcount, fill = lab), 
             position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
    labs(x = "Total Read Count of Top 25% Off-Targets", y = "Editing Target Site", 
         fill = "Lab")
```

### Ratio of on-target read counts to the off-target sequence with the highest read count

The on-target read count divided by the most prevalent off-target sequence (the off-target sequence with the largest read count) for each sample is plotted for each lab. 

``````{r}
ggplot(on_top_off_df) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = target_site, y = on_off_max_ratio, fill = lab), 
               shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
        labs(x = "Editing Target Site", y = "On-Target Rate to Most Prevalent Off-Target", 
         fill = "Lab")
```

As seen with the on-target rate considering total read counts, NIST has higher rates than St. Jude-sequenced samples. 

### Read counts per subsitution number for each sample

For each substitution number (or for indels only or subs/indels which are grouped separately), the number of off-target sequences that are classified as such as such are plotted for each target sample and lab. 

__NOTE__ I currently have these plotting read counts but we may want to either replace this with or add another graph that shows occurrences for each sub number.

```{r}
indel_df <- off_target_seq_align_df %>% 
  select(-total_sub_only_seqs) %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "diff_cat", values_to = "read_count", 
               cols = c("total_indels_only","total_sub_or_indel"))

### Venn Bar Plots

As opposed to the typical venn diagrams, these show relative abundance and give appropriate scaling to visualize values. 

__NOTE__ NATE - can we add the values on the graph??

```{r}
off_target_scatter_df <- off_target_df %>% 
  select(Chromosome, Start, End, Nuclease_Read_Count, target_site, lab) %>%
  filter(!lab == "NSS")

off_target_lab_set <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>% 
  filter(!lab == "NSS") %>%
  group_by(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site) %>% 
  summarise(lab_set = str_c(sort(lab), collapse = "-"))

venn_df <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>%
  filter(!lab == "NSS") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "lab", values_from = "Nuclease_Read_Count", values_fill = NA) %>%
  left_join(off_target_lab_set)

ggplot(data = venn_df) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = target_site, fill = lab_set), position = "fill") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Target Site", 
       y = "Proportion of Coordinates", 
       fill = "Lab Combinations")
```

```{r}
venn_bar_table <- venn_df %>%
  group_by(target_site) %>%
  summarise(lab_set, target_site)
```


### Read Count Replicate v Replicate Scatter Plots
#### Overlapping Off-Target Coordinates

To mimic the plots of Figure1, i in the CHANGE-Seq manuscript, common genomic coordinates of off-targets for each sample replicates are plotted in log scale. 

```{r}
## NSN vs. NSS: Concordant Off-Target Coordinates
nsn_v_nss <- off_target_scatter_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "lab", values_from = "Nuclease_Read_Count", values_fill = 0) %>% 
   filter(NSS != 0, NSN != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NSN, y = NSS)) + 
   geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
   ggpubr::stat_cor(aes(label = ..rr.label..), method = "pearson") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, ncol = 1) + 
  theme_bw()

## NSN vs. NNN: Concordant Off-Target Coordinates
nsn_v_nnn <- off_target_scatter_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "lab", values_from = "Nuclease_Read_Count", values_fill = 0) %>% 
   filter(NSN != 0, NNN != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NSN, y = NNN)) + 
   geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
   ggpubr::stat_cor(aes(label = ..rr.label..), method = "pearson") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, ncol = 1) + 
  theme_bw()

## NSS vs. NNN: Concordant Off-Target Coordinates
nss_v_nnn <- off_target_scatter_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "lab", values_from = "Nuclease_Read_Count", values_fill = 0) %>% 
   filter(NSS != 0, NNN != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NSS, y = NNN)) + 
   geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
   ggpubr::stat_cor(aes(label = ..rr.label..), method = "pearson") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, ncol = 1) + 
  theme_bw()
```

```{r fig.height= 6}
ggpubr::ggarrange(nsn_v_nss, nsn_v_nnn, nss_v_nnn, ncol = 3)
```

#### Unique Read Count Occurrence Plots
The read count values for the off-target coordinates unique to replicate 1, replicate 2, and the intersection of the replicates was extracted. Unique read count values from all 3 data were then used to tally each occurrence across the unique genomic coordinates for replicate 1, replicate 2. and the intersection of the replicates

**Our traditional way of viewing**

```{r fig.height = 4}
nnn_nsn_lab_set <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>% 
  group_by(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site) %>% 
  filter(lab != "NSS") %>% 
  summarise(lab_set = str_c(sort(lab), collapse = "-"))

rep_count_scatter_df <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>% 
  filter(lab != "NSS") %>% 
  right_join(nnn_nsn_lab_set) %>% 
  count(target_site, lab_set, Nuclease_Read_Count, name = "Occurence")
  
ggplot(rep_count_scatter_df) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Nuclease_Read_Count, y = Occurence, fill = lab_set), shape = 21) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```


**Density view**

```{r}
nnn_nsn_lab_set <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>% 
  group_by(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site) %>% 
  filter(lab != "NSS") %>% 
  summarise(lab_set = str_c(sort(lab), collapse = "-"))

rep_count_scatter_df <- off_target_df %>%
  select(`Genomic Coordinate`, target_site, lab, Nuclease_Read_Count) %>% 
  filter(lab != "NSS") %>% 
  right_join(nnn_nsn_lab_set)

ggplot(rep_count_scatter_df) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Nuclease_Read_Count, fill = lab_set)) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw()

```

**This is plotting the proportion of sites (occurrence / total read count) as opposed to just occurrence number as an attempt to normalize**

```{r}
rep_count_scatter_df %>% 
  mutate(lab_set = factor(lab_set, level = c("NNN-NSN", "NNN","NSN"))) %>% 
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Nuclease_Read_Count, fill = lab_set), position = "fill") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~target_site, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 2) +
  labs(x = "Read Count", y = "Proportion of Sites")

```
