In the tidy_replicate_analysis.Rmd file: 

Specific things to call attention to:

- line 284: would a different kind of graph be better? Probably but I need to think about it. We can chat about plotting next week.
- line 330: how do I make a plot similar to that on line 288-303 where each panel has a sample and x axis has substitution number. I don't think I'm understanding the code in that plot.  - Added the plot I think you were looking for.
